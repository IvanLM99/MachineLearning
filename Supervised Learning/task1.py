Task 1 involved the application of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) to a dataset, 
yielding a model with particular performance metrics. 
The average accuracy obtained was 0.650, indicating the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. 
Precision, measuring the accuracy of positive predictions, was 0.835 on average, while the average recall, 
reflecting the model's ability to capture positive instances, stood at 0.708. 
Additionally, the F1 score, harmonizing precision and recall, averaged at 0.614.

The model's decision boundaries were represented by quadratic equations (g_1(x), g_2(x), and g_12(x)), 
portraying the separation between classes 1 and 2. 
Coefficients for these equations were calculated using mean and covariance matrices for each class, 
providing insights into how the model distinguishes between different classes based on the dataset's features.

This evaluation showcases the QDA model's performance in accurately predicting and distinguishing between classes, 
demonstrating reasonable accuracy, precision, and recall. 
The derived quadratic equations offer a visual understanding of the decision boundaries established by the model.
